## Okapi Mobile App:

This is an implementation of real-time chat application using React Native  and Expo Router. The app is built using Expo, a framework for building universal apps with React Native.

The app serves as oral assistant for the user. The user can ask questions and get answers in real-time. The app also provides a chat interface for the user to chat with the assistant.
 
We're aiming to use a (post-trained) fine-tuned model on a large audio dataset to provide the best possible answers to the user's questions, to get the best possible answers to the user's questions.
